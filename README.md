# Monument Recognition - Resnet #
Image Classification pipeline with the help of state-of-the-art model (ResNet based model) to classify monuments using Monument Recognition dataset. An example of transfer learning module which automates the process of identifying the monuments and to retrieve similar images for studying art forms in greater detail. It does so with the help of a PyTorch pretrained ResNet-50 model.

### Softwares and Tools used ###
* Google Colaboratory- A free cloud service by Google which provides free GPU to train the model.
* PyTorch Library - Contains pre-coded functions and modules along with various pretrained S-O-T-A models.
